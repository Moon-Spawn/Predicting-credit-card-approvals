# Predicting-credit-card-approvals
Using Logistic Regression and Grid Search to predict credit card approvals.

Applications for credit cards get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report.
In this project automatic credit card approval predictor is built using Logistic Regression.
The dataset was taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository
